# Overview

Insert overview text here. The agent will only see this should they choose to apply the rule.

## Componentization

When creating a new component, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file in the `components` directory.
2. Create a new component in the file.
3. Export the component.
4. Import the component into the file where it is used.
5. Use the component in the file.

## Props

When defining props for a component, follow these steps:

1. Define the props in the file.
2. Only export the props if needed.
3. Name the props type "Props" if it's not exported.

## Component

Use shadcn/ui components whenever possible, if the component is not available, add it using the associated `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` command.
For example, to add a button, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add button
```

This will add the button component to the `components` directory and import it into the file where it is used. Do not overwrite existing components, only add new ones.

## Icons

Use Lucide React for icons.

## Language

When writing code, you should not write any text directly in the code, you should use the `useTranslation` hook to get the text.
If the text does not exist, create it in the `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json` files.

## Translation Keys

When creating a new translation key, follow these steps:

1. Create a new key in the `locales/en.json` and `locales/fr.json` files.
2. Use the `t` function to get the text.

## Styling

When styling a component, follow these steps: use the `cn` utility to merge classes, use the `tailwindcss` plugin to style the component.
